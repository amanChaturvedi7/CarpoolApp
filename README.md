# Carpool App
This is an android application that would help people to collaborate and travel together.
By having more people using one vehicle, carpooling reduces each person’s travel
costs such as fuel costs, tolls, and the stress of driving. Carpooling is also seen as a
more environmentally friendly and sustainable way to travel as sharing journeys
reduces carbon emissions, traffic congestion on the roads, and the need for parking
spaces. Authorities often encourage carpooling, especially during high pollution periods
and high fuel prices.
